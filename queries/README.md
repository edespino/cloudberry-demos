- **Distribution**: Strategic distribution key choices
- **Maintenance**: Statistics and health monitoring

## Tips for Best Results

### Before Running Queries:
1. **Ensure fresh statistics**: `ANALYZE passenger; ANALYZE flights; ANALYZE booking;`
2. **Check ORCA is enabled**: `SHOW optimizer;` (should be 'on')
3. **Verify data is loaded**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM booking;`

### For Performance Testing:
1. **Use appropriate scale**: Start with scale 1, increase to 5-25 for testing
2. **Enable timing**: `\timing on` before running performance queries
3. **Clear caches**: Restart database between major tests if needed

### For Learning:
1. **Read execution plans**: Focus on Motion operations and costs
2. **Compare optimizers**: Run same query with both ORCA and PostgreSQL
3. **Experiment with hints**: Try different pg_hint_plan options

### For Production Use:
1. **Monitor regularly**: Use troubleshooting queries for health checks
2. **Update statistics**: Schedule regular ANALYZE operations
3. **Watch for skew**: Monitor data distribution balance

## Environment-Specific Notes

### For gpdemo (Development):
- Use port 7000: `psql -h localhost -p 7000 -d airline_demo`
- Smaller scale factors (1-5) work well
- Limited memory settings - adjust work_mem if needed

### For Production:
- Use port 5432: `psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d airline_demo` 
- Scale factors 10-100 for serious performance testing
- Monitor resource usage with larger datasets

## Integration with Demo Scripts

These query files complement the main demo scripts:

```bash
# Generate data at desired scale
./run-demo.sh --method enhanced --scale 5

# Run specific query collections
psql -d airline_demo -f queries/01-mpp-joins.sql
psql -d airline_demo -f queries/05-advanced-analytics.sql

# Or interactive exploration
psql -d airline_demo
\i queries/02-window-functions.sql
```

## Contributing

When adding new query files:
1. Follow the naming convention: `NN-category-name.sql`
2. Include comprehensive `\echo` statements for section headers
3. Add explanatory comments for complex queries
4. Update this README with the new file description
5. Test with multiple scale factors to ensure robustness
